### Requirments
* python2
* numpy
* scipy
* skimage
* pandas
* tensorflow == 1.5.0 (I have not testted with other versions)
* keras == 2.0.8 (I have tried latter versions, but they throw a bug. Not sure from where it came from)
* tqdm 


For the commands reproducing experiments from the paper check scripts folder.

All scripts has the following name: (name of the dataset) + (architecture type (resnet or dcgan)) +
(discriminator normalization (sn or wgan_gp)) + (conditional of unconditional) + (if conditional use soft assigment (sa)).

For example:

```CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 scripts/cifar10_resnet_sn_uncond.sh```

will train GAN for cifar10 dataset, with resnet architecture, spectral normalized discriminator in unconditional case.


All dataset except for imagenet downloaded and trained at the same time.

### Imagenet

0. This will consume a loot of memory. Because dataset is packed into numpy files for sequential reads.
1. Download imagenet [ILSVRC2012](http://image-net.org/download-images). Train and val. Put train to ../ILSVRC2012/train, and val to ../ILSVRC2012/val/val (val/val is important)
2. Preprocess  imagenet train:

```bash preprocess.sh ../ILSVRC2012/train ../imagenet-resized```

3. Preprocess imagenet val:

```bash preprocess.sh ../ILSVRC2012/val ../imagenet-resized-val```

4. Now you can remove ILSVRC2012
5. ```CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 scripts/imagenet_resnet_sn_cond_sa.sh``` This will first pack imagenet into numpy files, and then start traning.
